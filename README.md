# Soliditychallenge 
This is a simple Solidity smart contract that defines four state variables and provides four functions to set and retrieve the values of these variables. Here's a brief description of what each part of the code does:

- `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`: This is a special comment that specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, it specifies that the code is released under the MIT license.

- `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`: This is a Solidity version pragma that specifies the version of the Solidity compiler that should be used to compile this code.

- `contract mycontracts {`: This is the start of the Solidity contract definition. The name of the contract is `mycontracts`.

- `string myString;`: This is a state variable that stores a string value.

- `int myint;`: This is a state variable that stores an integer value.

- `bool myBool;`: This is a state variable that stores a boolean value.

- `address myAddress;`: This is a state variable that stores an Ethereum address.

- `function setMyString(string memory _value) public {`: This is a function that takes a string value as input and sets the value of the `myString` state variable to this input value.

- `function getMyString() public view returns (string memory) {`: This is a function that returns the value of the `myString` state variable.

- `function setMyint(int _value) public {`: This is a function that takes an integer value as input and sets the value of the `myint` state variable to this input value.

- `function getMyint() public view returns (int) {`: This is a function that returns the value of the `myint` state variable.

- `function setMyBool(bool _value) public {`: This is a function that takes a boolean value as input and sets the value of the `myBool` state variable to this input value.

- `function getMyBool() public view returns (bool) {`: This is a function that returns the value of the `myBool` state variable.

- `function setMyAddress(address _value) public {`: This is a function that takes an Ethereum address as input and sets the value of the `myAddress` state variable to this input value.

- `function getMyAddress() public view returns (address) {`: This is a function that returns the value of the `myAddress` state variable.
